**I am a** postdoctoral researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), under the National Center for Computational Sciences. 
I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry from Northwestern University in 2020 with an award for excellence in graduate research,
and my B.S. in Chemistry from National Taiwan University in 2015.

**My Ph.D. research topic at Northwestern University** is modeling experimental data with computational simulations and machine learning methods.
My Ph.D. work focused on using time-resolved X-ray techniques (scattering and spectroscopy) to understand, in real time, what happens in proteins and small molecules when they are perturbed by environmental stimuli, such as light excitation or temperature jump.
Halfway through the Ph.D. time, my research transitioned into integrating X-ray data into molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the active sampling of data-compatible protein structures.

**My postdoctoral work at AstraZeneca** is about modeling the conformational change of Ataxia-telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) protein between closed and open states based on CryoEM data, and attempting to find a complete pathway through Markov-state sodeling and metadynamics simulations.

**My postdoctoral works at Oak Ridge National Lab** are developing (1) high-throughput molecular dynamics for induced-fit docking based ligand binding pose prediction, (2) Machine learning of ligand binding pose prediction based on AlphaFold concepts, and (3) Direct electron density retrieval methods based on wide-angle X-ray scattering. 


In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, birdwatching, tennis, and photography.
