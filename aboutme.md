subtitle: Postdoctoral researcher at Oak Ridge National Lab

Hi! I am Darren Hsu.
 
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), under the National Center for Computational Sciences. 
I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry from Northwestern University in 2020 with an award for excellence in graduate research,
and my B.S. in Chemistry from National Taiwan University in 2015.
I enjoy modeling experimental data with computational simulations and machine learning methods.
My Ph.D. work focused on using time-resolved X-ray techniques (scattering and spectroscopy) to understand, in real time, what happens in proteins and small molecules when they are perturbed by environmental stimuli.
Halfway through the Ph.D. time, my research transitioned into integrating X-ray data into molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the active sampling of data-compatible protein structures.
After graduating from NU, I joined AstraZeneca as a Postdoctoral Fellow, studying cryoEM-based structural modeling method, also with MD simulations.
As a Postdoc at ORNL, I am studying how to refine drug binding pose _in silico_ in a high-throughput manner, as well as how to predict these poses with AI models.
