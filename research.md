This is my main Ph.D. project where we try to guide the protein motions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the data we collected, which is time-resolved X-ray solution scattering signal (TRXSS) of proteins. For example, we try to drive the 1LST structure to the 2LAO structure using only the TRXSS signal difference between the two structures.

The TRXSS signal reflects changes in the atomic distance distribution, which can be modeled with the Debye formula. However Debye formula is very expensive (proportional to number of scatterers squared) so I developed GPU code to do parallel computing, giving it a 12,000x boost in efficiency.

## Finding the Unfolded State of a Protein

<!--During my Ph.D. I have been working with Prof. Lin Chen at Northwestern University on tracking and characterizing disordered protein structures when they are subject to external excitation, such as light, temperature-jump, pH-jump, or chemical reduction. I did a large part of my research at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, where I utilized the BioCARS beamline for time-resolved X-ray solution scattering, 11-ID-D beamline for X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy, and DND-CAT for small-angle X-ray scattering.-->

With the above method established, I decided to examine an intermediate unfolded state (*molten globule*) of the alpha-lactalbumin.
A temperature jump is applied to the protein solution, causing the protein the unfold. We then use TRXSS to track its unfolding in real time.
The signal is then input to the MD simulation, generating a different set of structures (the cyan ones in the figure; the purple one is the crystal structure) that are compatible with the data, the kinetic model, and the traditional descriptions of the *molten globule* state.
This is then our best guess of what the protein looks like in this state, and the modeling allows us to see the structure and gain insight into the system.

Docking pose means the output structures of the ligands generated by docking programs (e.g. AutoDock Vina) when protein is frozen.
We refine this (usually low quality) prediction by allowing the ligand and the nearby protein sidechains to move in an MD fashion.
Additionally we truncate to protein to form a small system, taking advantage of **mdgx.cuda** in the AmberTools to flood the conformational space.
We also build a model zoo of XGBoost classifiers to judge which MD snapshots are more likely to be close to a crystal pose.

## Deep Learning Model for Simultaneous Protein & Ligand Structure Prediction

**Keywords: Deep Learning, Transformers, Artificial Intelligence, Protein Folding, Ligand Binding, Structure Prediction**

We built proof-of-concept, transformer-based language models to show we can predict both protein structure and ligand binding poses from just protein sequences and ligand SMILES strings.
This work is a part of our **TwoFold** submission to the Gordon Bell Special Prize for High Performance Computing-Based COVID-19 Research, which is selected as a finalist to present in the Supercomputing 22 conference.
